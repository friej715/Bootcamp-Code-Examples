// Simple Math Example

// We all should have a simple understanding of operators.
// In programming you are going to be using all of these all the time
// How do they end work together in a group?
// This is known as operator precedence

// First everything in parenthesis is done
int a1 = (3 + 6) * (72/9) + 8 - 40 / 2;
println(a1);

// Second * and / are all done
int a2 = 9 * 8 + 8 - 40 / 2;
println(a2);

// Last bu not least, the + and - are completed
int a3 = 72 + 8 - 20;
println(a3);

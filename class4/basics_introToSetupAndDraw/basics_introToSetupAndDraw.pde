/* Basics - Loops
 A loop is just a section of code that is run over and
 over again. Draw is one such loop--it starts at the top,
 goes to the bottom, and them loops back up to the top
 over and over again until we stop the sketch.
 
 Let's demonstrate.

void setup() { 
  println("Hello!"); // This will be printed once. Why?
}

void draw() {
  println("1");
  println("2");
  println("3");
  println("4");
  
  // These will be printed over and over again. Why?
}

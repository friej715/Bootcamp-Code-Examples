/* Booleans!
- booleans are a simple data type with only two states (true and false)
- they make it much easier to build applications that have chronological or systematic steps. This will
become much more relevant when you have additional modes of interaction (mouse click, key press, etc.).
Right now all we have is mouseX and mouseY, but a pseudocode example is as follows:
  ex:
  - Sketch starts with step1=true, step2=false, step3=false
  (in draw):
  - when done with step1:  step1=false, step2=true
  - when done with step2:  step2=false, step3=true
  and so on...

    increases by 1 each time you cross the "mid-line".  If the boolean wasn't here the 
    counter would increase with each frame if you kept your mouse on the right side of 
    the midline.

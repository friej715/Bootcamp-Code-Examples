Bootcamp-Code-Examples
======================

This git repository is for **MFAD+T Bootcamp Team F** (w00t w00t!).

Each class file will contain:

* Slides that you can reference after class, in case you get lost/confused
* Thoroughly commented sample code for each class day, so you can see the concepts in action
* Even more sample code written by other Bootcamp instructors (as noted in surrounding file)

There's also class syllabus, which details both topics and specific code (with links to the official reference). This will evolve over time as I see how y'all are coping with code. It is slightly different than the other syllabi.

Class 1 doesn't exist here, since that day we'll be hearing from some awesome pro-coders/interactive designers and getting to know each other.

Absolutely dig into these and mess 'em up. Change values, colors, where things are in loops... it's the best way to learn. If you totally screw up the file, just re-download it. Simple!
